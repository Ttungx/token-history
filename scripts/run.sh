# Why a wrapper: the interpreter you get from an interactive shell and the one a
# scheduler gets are often different builds. On the machine this was written on,
# `python3` was Anaconda 3.11 in the terminal but /usr/bin/python3 3.9 under
# launchd — the classic "works when I test it, misbehaves at 00:30" split.
#
# So: prefer `uv run`, which pins the interpreter to .python-version and is
# identical on every machine. Fall back to a plain python3 when uv is absent —
# the scripts are standard-library-only and 3.9-compatible, so the fallback is a
# real path, not a courtesy. Nobody is forced to install uv to use a fork.
